Communication

 Structured meetings

I believe we struggled a bit with coming up with the solutions and then connecting what we did because we missed communication. 

So, for the final project, I think we should be consistent with time and structure for our morning meetings. I suggest we utilize a Scrum approach and answer the following questions:

- What did I work on yesterday?
- What am I working on today?
- What issues are blocking me?

These questions highlight progress and help flag problems. Also, it strengthens the team when everyone shares the progress theyâ€™re contributing to the team. 
 Internal communication first

Also, I think we should follow the #11 principle of the Agile Manifesto: "Self-organizing teams reflect technical and design excellence".

The concept is basically about the team trying to come up with a solution first before relying on some outside resource.

In our case, it would be coming to the group with the problems first before speaking to a mentor. It will be helpful and more effective because we're involved in the project and know its structure and goals. However, we can still reach out to mentors, but I'd suggest we do it for technical issues only and not for logic.

 Help other team members to achieve their goals

Lastly, I should've reached out to you more often and given you more support. I think you could've learned more and had fewer problems if I had shared my experience with you. 

So for the final project, I'll engage more with you guys to provide help.

Front-End design concepts

As developers, when working on the front-end, our job is to turn designs into reality via code. It's important for us to learn this skill, because it's an industry standard. For that, we should follow the concepts below.

1. Match the design, don't try to beat it
2. Typography makes all the difference
3. Pay attention to relationships and hierarchy of the page
4. Be picky about whitespace and alignment
5. Get feedback before pushing code

It may sound obvious, but how we display our data matters as much as the data itself. A well-designed website can help us make a good impression on prospective employers. More importantly, it provides a good user experience and helps visitors easily access and navigate our website.

Feature by feature

After thinking about the project, I understand what Warren told us about working feature by feature, and the most granular, the better. Here's a list of some advantages:

1. We can focus on delivering that feature to a high standard rather than trying to balance multiple tasks or features at once.
2. It provides more visibility into the project's progress and helps to ensure that everyone knows what is being worked on and what needs to be done.
3. We can ensure that each feature is well-designed, thoroughly tested, and of high quality, which helps improve the product's overall quality.
4. We can incorporate feedback more easily.
5. We are more likely to design and implement a feature in a way that can be easily reused in future features.

Of course, there are a lot of other advantages, but the list above summarizes the most important ones for us.

Potential Employers

Just like we did during midterms, we will have to present this project to a large crowd, and I'm 99% sure our potential employers will be in the audience. That said, we must strive to create software or site that follows industry standards. Here's a list of things we should consider:

1. The software or website should be responsive, as most users use mobile to access them.
2. We should select the correct tags for each element, e.g. <h1> is for the most important headings, links should be used with <a> tag, <nav> is for navigation links etc.
3. Files names must be all lowercase and may include dashes, and it should describe what the file does, e.g. a file with some functions for a shopping cart should be named shopping-cart.js
4. A file should have only code that relates to its purpose; for example, a get-all-cards.js should have just one function that gets all cards, and a index.js route file should have only one get route for the index

We may find problems that aren't covered in this text, and we can come up with an agreement when it arises
